#Does Js have classes

 Classes in javascript were introduced in ES6 as a more convenient and clearer syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritence,
 however under the hood classes system is still based on prototypes.

 Classes in javascript are syntactic sugar over the already existing protype-based-inheritence system. That mean's they are the nicer way of doing what 
 javascript has already been able to do.
